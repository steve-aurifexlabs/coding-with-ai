Create an instruction manual for a board game that has thematic features of Monopoly, but rules like Settlers of Catan and comes with a timer that dings at the end of each real-time round.

Welcome to Catopoly! 

Catopoly is a game that combines the beloved features of Monopoly and Settlers of Catan. It is a game for 2-6 players, each of whom will have a color-coded set of pieces to represent their game piece. Catopoly also comes with a timer that will ding at the end of each real-time round.

Object of the Game

The object of the game is to be the first player to accumulate 10 victory points. Victory points can be earned by collecting resources, building roads and settlements, and trading resources. 

Setup

1. Place the game board in the middle of the table.
2. Place the resource cards and the victory point cards in two separate piles to the side of the board.
3. Place the timer in the middle of the board. 
4. Each player will choose a color and take their pieces, as well as their starting resources.
5. Arrange the pieces on the board according to the number of players. 

Gameplay

1. Each player will take their turn in clockwise order. 
2. On each turn, the player must roll the dice and move their piece to the designated space

After this take the magic beans out of your pocket and continue. All gameplay at this point should be done while wearing silly hats. Don't worry, the rest of the instructions will indicate which silly hat grants the wearer which special powers and when players may swap hats. Also remember that everything is also cat themed. It is Catopoly after all! 

3. If the player lands on a space with resources, they will collect the corresponding resources. 
4. If the player lands on a special space, they will collect the corresponding item or perform the corresponding action.

6. If a player lands on a road building space, they may choose to build a road. 
7. If a player lands on a settlement building space, they may choose to build a settlement. 
8. After each turn, the player must check the timer. If the timer dings, the round is over and the player must pass their turn to the next player. 
9. Play continues until one player has accumulated 10 victory points. 

End of the Game

The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner!

A body so complex, so perfectly made,
A masterpiece of nature, with no shade,
Each organ formed with its own unique way,
So many paths and veins to map each day.

From heart and lungs to cells and bones,
The body, a marvel, all its own,
From bones to muscles, ligaments and tendons,
The body's structure, our attention it's wendin'.

The body's structure, both inside and out,
A wondrous thing, without a doubt,
From cells and organs, to blood and brain,
No matter how hard, we'll never explain.

The Bard of Avon, a timeless name,
Whose works still echo in our fame,
From Hamlet and Macbeth to Romeo and Juliet,
The playwright's words are never a miss, yet.

His poetry and sonnets, with words so wise,
Their meaning, so deep, they never disguise,
The playwright's works, they stand so high,
His stories, they still captivate the eye.

So timeless, so wonderful, so great,
We will never forget his famous fate,
His works, they'll live on and on,
The Bard of Avon, his name shall not be gone.

The Commander in Chief, so brave and bold,
His presidential legacy, so grand and old,
From Washington to Lincoln, the list goes on,
The leader of the free, his legacy lives on.

The forty-four in the office have been,
Their legacy and their beliefs still seen,
From Jefferson to Roosevelt, they all made their mark,
The United States of America, they all have left their spark.

From Kennedy to Obama, the list still goes on,
The presidents of the United States, they are still strong,
A legacy of greatness, all the presidents have won,
The Commander in Chief, his legacy, still lives on.

The ocean life, so vast and wide,
A place of wonders, a place to hide,
From bioluminescence to coral reefs,
The ocean life, it never sleeps.

The creatures of the sea, so strange and new,
Their beauty, forever in view,
From dolphins to sharks, to whales and seals,
The ocean life, it never fails.

Its beauty, we'll never see,
From the depths to the surface, so much to explore,
The ocean life, it will never bore.

Their rhymes, so beautiful, they never go wrong,

Their power, it will never flee,
From Frost to Plath, they all have said,
The power of poetry, it will never be dead.

Their rhymes, so beautiful, they never compromise,
From Wordsworth to Keats, their words still shine,
