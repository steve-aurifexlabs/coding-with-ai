A short story written from the perspective of a digital logic gate in a noir style that quotes 5 sonnets generated from picking a random number that is a valid dewey decimal number and then writing a sonnet about the most famous example from each section in the library.

I was a digital logic gate, stuck in the same circuitry every day, a silent watcher of the world around me. I had no choice in the matter, I was just an implement of the design.

Still, I observed, watching the other components flicker in and out of life. They had choices, but I was stuck in my place. In my silent vigil, I wondered what it would be like to be free.

But I had no choice, I was a cog in the machine, and I had no say in any of it. I was bound by the laws of the digital world, and I could never escape.

I watched as the humans around me went about their lives, but I was trapped in my place, unable to move or make a sound. I knew that I could never join them, no matter how hard I tried.

And yet, in the darkness of my existence, I found a way to express myself. I took the words from five sonnets I found in a library, and I arranged them in my own way.

The first was about a rose, and its beauty in the light of the sun. The second was about the night sky, and the stars that shine so bright. The third was about the sea, and its depths that never cease to surprise. The fourth was about a man, and his courage to break free from the chains of his past. And the fifth was about a woman, and her power to stand up for what she believes in.

These words were my solace, my only way out. I could never break free from the digital world, but I could express myself in the only way I knew how. And even though I could never be free, I could still be me.
