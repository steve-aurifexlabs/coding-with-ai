<h1>Meet Our Trainers</h1>

Can you write some css to make that html look modern. Pick a decent font please.

Sure, here is an example of some CSS that can be used to style the HTML document and make it look more modern:

Copy code
body {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1, h2, p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 32px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-bottom: 32px;
  text-align: center;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-bottom: 32px;
  text-align: justify;
}

strong {
  font-weight: 700;
}
This CSS uses the "Open Sans" font, which is a modern and clean sans-serif font that is easy to read on screens. It also sets some basic styles for the headings and paragraphs, including font sizes, weights, and spacing. This is just one possible way to style the document, and the exact details will depend on the specific requirements and design of the website.

How do I view this page if I saved it in a file in VS Code?

If you have saved the HTML boilerplate in a file in VS Code, you can view it by doing the following:

Open the HTML file in VS Code.
In the top menu, click on "View" and then select "Integrated Terminal" to open the integrated terminal.
In the terminal, run the following command to start a local web server:
Copy code
python -m http.server
In a web browser, go to the URL http://localhost:8000 to view the HTML page.
Alternatively, you can also use a different local web server of your choice, such as Apache or Nginx. The exact steps for viewing the page will depend on the web server you are using.

I got the following error. What do I do? 
 $ python -m http.server

Command 'python' not found, did you mean:

  command 'python3' from deb python3
  command 'python' from deb python-is-python3 

If you get the error "Command 'python' not found", it means that Python is not installed on your system, or it is not available in the PATH environment variable. In this case, you can either install Python and add it to the PATH variable, or you can use a different local web server of your choice, such as Apache or Nginx.

To install Python, you can follow the instructions on the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing Python, you will need to add it to the PATH variable so that it is available in the terminal. To do this, you can follow the instructions in this guide: https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/

Alternatively, if you prefer to use a different web server, you can follow the instructions for that web server to start the server and view the HTML page. For example, if you are using Apache, you can follow the instructions in this guide: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/getting-started.html

Can you update the CSS above to include different fonts for the different headings?

Sure, here is an example of how the CSS styles could be updated to include different fonts for the different headings:

Copy code
body {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1, h2, p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {
  font-family: "Lora", serif;
  font-size: 32px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-bottom: 32px;
  text-align: center;
}

h2 {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-bottom: 32px;
  text-align: justify;
}

strong {
  font-weight: 700;
}
This CSS uses the "Open Sans" font for the body text and the h2 headings, and the "Lora" font for the h1 headings. These are both modern and clean fonts that are easy to read on screens. This is just one possible way to use different fonts for the different headings, and the exact details will depend on the specific requirements and design of the website.
