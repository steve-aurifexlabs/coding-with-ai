# Coding with AI

All code is this repo was made by me with the help of Codex and ChatGPT. They show projects that involved editing, cherry picking, reprompting, and mostly editing generated code and re-running completion to force specific patterns. The game is the best example of this.

## First Batch

This first batch was all created in the first 24 hours of using ChatGPT and Codex.

### game

This worked really well creating an object oriented phaser game that follow the component-entity model. All done in the Codex playground.

### gym

This is a website for a local gym. This was done entirely with ChatGPT and copying the resulting code by hand. I added the images themselves.

### transfer-learning
Just ask for a training loop using pytorch and use the right words specific to ml. The code even works.

### taylor-c

C and assembly aren't languages that Codex will generally generate working code, but to get the basic shape of a performance measurement framework it worked quite well.

### phoneme

This is the building blocks for a phoneme based audio compressor. Codex really did the annoying work of dealing with all the specific audio processing, ml, and file I/O.

### kinematics

A robot arm solver.

### embedded

This takes an existing state machine implementation and example usage, and adds a new state.
